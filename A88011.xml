         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Dated from Paris June 29.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <p>THe 25 inſtant in the Evening, the Lievt. Civil was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet by a great number of people in the Chaſtelet, which is one of the comon priſons of the City, and they ſeeing the Gates made faſt, and thoſe in the houſe to be in a poſture of defence, and in a capacity to oppoſe them, did ſet fire to the Gate, which had it not been ſoon quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might have proved very ominous to that City, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon harſh Language paſſing the one againſt the other, from words they fell to knocking, where ſome few were ſlain on both ſides, and thoſe that were detained there, could not go out till 11 at night. The laſt time the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſate, there was but little ſpoken about the Union between the Princes, by reaſon that the Parliament will not meddle too far therein, but keep in a neutrality, that ſo they may be ſtill within the capacity of Mediatours, and becauſe the King by his laſt anſwer to their Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance preſented to him at Melun, his Majeſty doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that his deſire is, That the Cardinal be firſt juſtified of all thoſe things that are laid to his charge, and next that ſeeing he muſt depart the Kingdome, that he may be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115168:4"/> put into ſo honourable an employment as is beſitting his rank and eminent quality. The Princes having again ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the former Declaration by them made of laying down their arms ſo ſoon as the Cardinal was gone out of the Land. The Parliament thereupon paſſed 2 Votes, to this effect, That all the Declarations, Decrees, Orders, and Votes which have been made for the baniſhing of the Cardinal Mazarine out of the Land, ſhould be executed in their full tenour, and without any hopes of return. Monſieur du Portai roſe up, and ſaid, He knew no fitter employment for him, then to ſend him to carry their anſwer to the Letter of the Queen of Sweden, which would put him into his firſt trade of a Letter-Carrier, or Meſſenger; in the mean time the general report here is, that the peace is made between the King and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Duke of Orleans having ſpoken the ſame two days ſince, which is much doubted by many, by reaſon of the great difficulties which meet in the buſineſs, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affirmed by many, that the affairs are brought to that period, upon the earneſt inſtance of the Court to have the Princes ſubſcribe the return of the Cardinal after a certain time, which the princes refuſe to do, onely they will make the promiſe verbally, but nothing in writing; but whether the peace be concluded or not, there is no other talk about the City, and ſo I beleeve you will hear the ſame by many Letters. The Court is removed from Melun, and come near St. Denis, and as ſome ſay, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected here to morrow, being now but three Leagues off this City; The Kings Army is ſtill at Claye, and the Princes Army at S. Clou, and ſo all along to Surenne, The Duke of Lorrain is by this time at his own home, and hath put out a Declaration by way of Apologie to juſtifie himſelf about thoſe imputations laid upon him concerning the late Treaty: Charls Stuart and his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115168:4"/> remain ſtill as priſoners in the Louvre not daring to ſhew there heads abroad, they being ſo much hated of all the people about their late actions in the Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and the Duke of Lorrain, ſo that it is thought he will not tarry here long, but whether for Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark or the Palatinate, is not known.</p>
               <p>By Letters from Venice, thus. We hear there arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved lately from Conſtantinople, in that City an Expreſs with Letters, wherein the Great Turk and his Councel ſeem very much inclined to the peace; and thereupon the Senatour Giovanni Capello is choſen to goe as Embaſſadour Extraordinary for the States, who is to be gone with all ſpeed to make the firſt Overtures, and ſo try whether it may be brought to ſome concluſion. In Dalmatia the Turks being together in great bodies, there entred the country one Telepowick a renegado, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with him about 5000. who came near Spallatto, and did much ſpoil and waſt the Country, carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way great ſtore of people to make ſlaves, great ſtore of cattle and other rich booty, which the Morlacks hearing, did forthwith draw together in a very conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and being gone in purſuit, overtook them, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them ſo gallantly, that after ſome ſmall diſpute, put them to a rout in the Plain of Cracovy, two days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beyond Cliſſa: there was ſlain of the Turks about 400. a great number wounded, above 300 priſoners, and gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon the Turks, beſides what they had taken 450 horſes, and ſome Oxen, which were for the Train and carriage, beſides, being entred a days journey into Boſnia the enemies country, they burned ſome Villages, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away many priſoners, and ſo returned homewards. From Candia we hear, that the Turks having made a ſtrong attempt againſt that city, which they have cloſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115168:5"/> ſieged for theſe three years, which they thought to have ſurprized, but it being known to the Governour, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy was ſo well received that he retreated in a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly manner, leaving many of their men behind them. The Governour of Milan ſince his taking of Trin, hath again taken another caſtle in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and his forces do make many inroads in Piedmont, they give out that they will block up Caſal, but that ſeemeth not probable. The ſiege of Barcelona goeth on ſtill, but nothing is done late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there, that is any way conſiderable.</p>
               <p>From Scotland thus: There hath been lately a great riſing, and many declare for the Scots King, againſt the union with England, they are very imperious againſt the Parliaments ſouldiers, and ſome affronts hath been given; but that which is moſt diſmal is, the firing of about 100 houſes in Glaſcow.</p>
