            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Dated from Paris June 29.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <p>THe 25 in≈øtant in the Evening, the Lievt. Civil was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øet by a great number of people in the Cha≈øtelet, which is one of the comon pri≈øons of the City, and they ≈øeeing the Gates made fa≈øt, and tho≈øe in the hou≈øe to be in a po≈øture of defence, and in a capacity to oppo≈øe them, did ≈øet fire to the Gate, which had it not been ≈øoon quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might have proved very ominous to that City, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon har≈øh Language pa≈ø≈øing the one again≈øt the other, from words they fell to knocking, where ≈øome few were ≈ølain on both ≈øides, and tho≈øe that were detained there, could not go out till 11 at night. The la≈øt time the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ≈øate, there was but little ≈øpoken about the Union between the Princes, by rea≈øon that the Parliament will not meddle too far therein, but keep in a neutrality, that ≈øo they may be ≈øtill within the capacity of Mediatours, and becau≈øe the King by his la≈øt an≈øwer to their Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrance pre≈øented to him at Melun, his Maje≈øty doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that his de≈øire is, That the Cardinal be fir≈øt ju≈øtified of all tho≈øe things that are laid to his charge, and next that ≈øeeing he mu≈øt depart the Kingdome, that he may be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115168:4"/> put into ≈øo honourable an employment as is be≈øitting his rank and eminent quality. The Princes having again ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcribed the former Declaration by them made of laying down their arms ≈øo ≈øoon as the Cardinal was gone out of the Land. The Parliament thereupon pa≈ø≈øed 2 Votes, to this effect, That all the Declarations, Decrees, Orders, and Votes which have been made for the bani≈øhing of the Cardinal Mazarine out of the Land, ≈øhould be executed in their full tenour, and without any hopes of return. Mon≈øieur du Portai ro≈øe up, and ≈øaid, He knew no fitter employment for him, then to ≈øend him to carry their an≈øwer to the Letter of the Queen of Sweden, which would put him into his fir≈øt trade of a Letter-Carrier, or Me≈ø≈øenger; in the mean time the general report here is, that the peace is made between the King and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Duke of Orleans having ≈øpoken the ≈øame two days ≈øince, which is much doubted by many, by rea≈øon of the great difficulties which meet in the bu≈øine≈øs, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affirmed by many, that the affairs are brought to that period, upon the earne≈øt in≈øtance of the Court to have the Princes ≈øub≈øcribe the return of the Cardinal after a certain time, which the princes refu≈øe to do, onely they will make the promi≈øe verbally, but nothing in writing; but whether the peace be concluded or not, there is no other talk about the City, and ≈øo I beleeve you will hear the ≈øame by many Letters. The Court is removed from Melun, and come near St. Denis, and as ≈øome ≈øay, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected here to morrow, being now but three Leagues off this City; The Kings Army is ≈øtill at Claye, and the Princes Army at S. Clou, and ≈øo all along to Surenne, The Duke of Lorrain is by this time at his own home, and hath put out a Declaration by way of Apologie to ju≈øtifie him≈øelf about tho≈øe imputations laid upon him concerning the late Treaty: Charls Stuart and his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115168:4"/> remain ≈øtill as pri≈øoners in the Louvre not daring to ≈øhew there heads abroad, they being ≈øo much hated of all the people about their late actions in the Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and the Duke of Lorrain, ≈øo that it is thought he will not tarry here long, but whether for Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark or the Palatinate, is not known.</p>
               <p>By Letters from Venice, thus. We hear there arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved lately from Con≈øtantinople, in that City an Expre≈øs with Letters, wherein the Great Turk and his Councel ≈øeem very much inclined to the peace; and thereupon the Senatour Giovanni Capello is cho≈øen to goe as Emba≈ø≈øadour Extraordinary for the States, who is to be gone with all ≈øpeed to make the fir≈øt Overtures, and ≈øo try whether it may be brought to ≈øome conclu≈øion. In Dalmatia the Turks being together in great bodies, there entred the country one Telepowick a renegado, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with him about 5000. who came near Spallatto, and did much ≈øpoil and wa≈øt the Country, carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way great ≈øtore of people to make ≈ølaves, great ≈øtore of cattle and other rich booty, which the Morlacks hearing, did forthwith draw together in a very con≈øiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and being gone in pur≈øuit, overtook them, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them ≈øo gallantly, that after ≈øome ≈ømall di≈øpute, put them to a rout in the Plain of Cracovy, two days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny beyond Cli≈ø≈øa: there was ≈ølain of the Turks about 400. a great number wounded, above 300 pri≈øoners, and gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon the Turks, be≈øides what they had taken 450 hor≈øes, and ≈øome Oxen, which were for the Train and carriage, be≈øides, being entred a days journey into Bo≈ønia the enemies country, they burned ≈øome Villages, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away many pri≈øoners, and ≈øo returned homewards. From Candia we hear, that the Turks having made a ≈øtrong attempt again≈øt that city, which they have clo≈øe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115168:5"/> ≈øieged for the≈øe three years, which they thought to have ≈øurprized, but it being known to the Governour, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy was ≈øo well received that he retreated in a di≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly manner, leaving many of their men behind them. The Governour of Milan ≈øince his taking of Trin, hath again taken another ca≈øtle in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and his forces do make many inroads in Piedmont, they give out that they will block up Ca≈øal, but that ≈øeemeth not probable. The ≈øiege of Barcelona goeth on ≈øtill, but nothing is done late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there, that is any way con≈øiderable.</p>
               <p>From Scotland thus: There hath been lately a great ri≈øing, and many declare for the Scots King, again≈øt the union with England, they are very imperious again≈øt the Parliaments ≈øouldiers, and ≈øome affronts hath been given; but that which is mo≈øt di≈ømal is, the firing of about 100 hou≈øes in Gla≈øcow.</p>
